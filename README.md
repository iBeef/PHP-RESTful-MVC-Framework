# PHP-RESTful-MVC-Framework
A modification to Brad Traversy's MVC framework to allow for RESTful routing. This is my first real PHP project away from tutorials in an attempt to understand the inner workings of websites before learning a framework.

I've designed this simple framework to work very similar to express.
